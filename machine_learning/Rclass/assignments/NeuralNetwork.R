# Neural Networks attempt to model the human brain. Does so by having different inputs resembling logical gates. 
# Doing nonlinear modelling requires hidden layers (for example XOR)
# playground.tensorflow.org gives a way to visualize this.
# Three packages: nnet (simple), neuralnet (allows multiple hidden layers), keras (powerful python library). We'll use neuralnet.
